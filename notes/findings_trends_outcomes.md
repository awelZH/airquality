# Trends and outcomes: findings (not yet reworked)

Read before working on trends or outcomes.

The random forest meteo-normalisation has no seed, so `type == "Trend"` values vary between runs
(median 0.3 pp, max 2.5 pp of relative immission) – set a seed in phase 2a. A full project run takes
≈ 30 min for the trends and a few minutes for the rest. The YLL part of `_compile_outcomes.R` is
unfinished work (`year <- 2018`).
